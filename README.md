# High School Game CubeOfSpace3000

## Purpose

Project developed by me and my friends during the High School. Certainly isn't so well done how I would like currently. Actually we didn't have the knowlodge to create a better game, but with our limit skills we created the best product that we could and I am proud about the result. I need to thank my dear friends, Hugo CÃ©sar Peressin, Giovani dos Santos e VInicius Gabriel de Camargo by participated with me in this project in 2015.

I programmed the game by myself and my friends took care of the others contents like: the concept art, musics and gameplay.

There are soundtracks too from the game Megaman X4 and Megaman X5 !_!.
